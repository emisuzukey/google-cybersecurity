Basic queries 
    SELECT - indicates which columns to return 

    FROM - which table to query
        SELECT employee_id, device_id
        FROM employees;

    * - "all" 
        SELECT * 
        FROM employees;

    ORDERY BY - sequences records returned based on a specified column or columns
        SELECT customerid, city, country
        FROM customers
        ORDER BY city;

        DESC - changes sorting order
            SELECT customerid, city, country
            FROM customers
            ORDER BY city DESC;

        sorting based on multiple columns
            SELECT customerid, city, country
            FROM customers
            ORDER BY country, city;
            
                sorts by country, then for rows with the same country it sorts those by city
